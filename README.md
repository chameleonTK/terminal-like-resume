# The Terminal
This is my personal rÃ©sumÃ© presented in the form of a terminal interface â€” because why not make reading a CV a bit more fun? ðŸ’»ðŸ’»

You can navigate and explore my work and interests as if you're using a Unix-like command line. Use the following commands to interact:

## Available Commands
* `ls [-al] [folder]` List directory contents. Use `-al` for more details.

* `cd [folder]` Change the current directory. Navigate to different parts of my profile.

* `cat [file]` Print the contents of a file. Great for viewing my background or notes.

* `man` Display a manual page. Handy if you're lost.

## Examples
* `cd blog` To open my personal blog and explore what Iâ€™ve been thinking about lately.

* `cat experiences.txt` View a (slightly outdated) summary of my past work and experiences.

Feel free to click around or type in a command to learn more. This rÃ©sumÃ© might not follow tradition, just good old `cat` and `cd`.



## Install
1. install `gulp` via `npm install --global gulp-cli`
